get the wsl2 installed for linux and the docker desktop file, get the docker for desktop file open and slect the WSL2 option rather then Hyper V
--------------------------
Creating Docker File:
    we will create a docker file in the folder name Dockerfile
    Dockerfile we will write the below code
        we will put what language and what all other details need to create the images
        like if you need the Python to be in docker images you will use
                    
                    FROM Python:3.9-alpine

        we can also add the work directory, it means on which directory we are getting worked
                    
                    WORKDIR /tree
        
        and then we have to add the py file via ADD , there will be two arhgument which must return to ADD
        one is file name and other is the file path
            
                    ADD app.py /app.py
                            OR
                    ADD . .
            
            this means adding every file i this current location

        then we will give the command which need to run to run , return the list of two
        one with language and other is path , it must same as we write in ADD
                
                    CMD ['python','app.py']
            
            incase every file you ADD is not the python so the above CMD wont work
            what we do i add the endpoint 
                
                    ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
                    CMD ["app.py"]

        there is one more command like 

                    RUN a.txt
                    RUN echo hi
            just to run prgram on the go

    then we build the docker container
    
            docker build -t dockerFoldername .

        docker folder name will appear the Repository name in images so you can give whatever you want
        and if you want to read some certain DOcker fle in folder then you can use -file

            docker build -t dockerFoldername -f Dockerfile .
    
    now its time to run the build file container'

            docker run -it dockerfoldername   
-------------------------------
.DOCKERIGNORE
If some files you dont want to keep in the DockerContainer while building, just add it in
        .dockerignore 
    inside it enter the name of file. like node_module, app.py etc
    
---------------------------
MAPPING PORT:
    so when ever we use run the image it is running inside the docker, not on local device, so we can test it via localhost browser
    we have to made it available to localhost via Mapping the port

        docker run -it -p 4000:8000 ares-backend

    so here -p define the port and 4000 is the running port after localhost and 8000 is localhost
    (one thing your applicvation must be awat=re about port or you can make all port available
      in this flask app i will do via adding host='0.0.0.0' in the main run field)

-------------------
DOCKER COMMANDS:
    docker images:                     to get the list of docker images
    docker run container name:         to run the container (might be immediately stop the container)
    docker run -it ubuntu:             it will keep the container running 
    docker run -it -p 7990:80 nginx:   -p here is use to get the port, as you know the localhost run on our system, and the mginx will run in docker so just to expose it from docker we use -p port
    docker run -it -p 7990:80 -d nginx: to run container in background we use -d
    docker stop name:                  to stop running container
    docker ps:                         to list all runing container
    docker ps -a:                      to list all the container run in past
    docker logs container id:          to get the logs of container
    docker rmi imageid:                to remove image
    docker image ls dangling=true:     it makes all the image dangling so that we can remove it in one shot
    docker image prune:                and now it deletes all images
    docker rm name:                    to delete container
    docker rm $(docker ps -aq)         to delete all running history might be
    docker pull:                       (download an image) its pull the image from net not cpntainer
    curl:                              it is use to get response from particular server(we will use it for test port mapping)
