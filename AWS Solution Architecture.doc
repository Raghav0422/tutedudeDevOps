IAM & AWS CLI:
  User Group,Policies:
    * there can be lot of groups in single team, remeber the example of 6, three are devlopers , 2 are testers and one is independent, so they defined the group 
      now from that two teams devloper and the tester there will be another group of team leads
    * Permission is assigned to the each user and it depend on Group
    * permission data mainly stored in the form of JSON
    * Policies define the permission of the users
    * Json file basically contains:
          {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",  (never change it let it remain as it is)
            "Statement":[
              {
                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Action":"ec2.Describe*",
                "Resorce":"*",
              },
              {
                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Action":"elasticloadbalancing.Describe",
                "Resorce":"*",
              },
              {
                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Action":[
                  "cloudwatch":"ListMetrics",
                  "cloudwatch":"GetMetricsStatics",
                  "cloudwatch":"Describe",
                ],
                "Resorce":"*",
              },            ]
          }

  IAM User CREATION STEPS:
    * there are lots of services availble in AWS, directly search for IAM and you will see the option open it
    * IAM services are global you can in menu bar, that means no specific reason for it, where some other services has region
    * go to IAM-> on left Users -> 
      you will see 0 users (basically you are the root user and it is not the best practice to use the root user, you can check it in your profile dashbord top right)
    * we will create user via clicking on create user button
      enter User Name >> select the IAM user >> Select the Manual password >> setup the password (if its your ID)
      else just let go with Autigenerate password >> Ask for password reset on next login
    * Next it will ask to grant the permissions
      if you have any check it, else create a group >> click butto create group and then check it
      Set Group Name: Admin >> below there you will see list of policy name select the policy Adminstrator Access >> Click on create User Group
      so all done its setup and the new user is created along with grou also created
    * go to Dashboard , on right you will see the Account ID and the Signin, you can change your sign in link via clicking on Create "Account Allas"
    * so we ahve created the user and setted the allas name, no time to login
      just open new private window, go to ASW sigin page, you will see two options 
        Root USer 
        IAM User
      select the IAM user >> it will ask for the name 12 digit allas, enter the name which you had set >> signin

  IAM Policies:
    * Same 6 person diagram rule, groups divdided, and one person can have two policies, and one can have separate policiy only
    * Below is the structure:
      Consists of three things:
        1.  Version
        2.  Id
        3.  Statement: further statemnet consist of:
                        Sid, Effect, Principal, Action, Resource, Condition
          {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",  (policy language version, never change it let it remain as it is)
            "id":"S3-Account-Permission"  (it is just id of policy : optional)
            "Statement":[
              {
                "Sid":"1",  (id of statement : optional)
                "Effect":"Allow",  (whether statement Allow or deny access to certain API )
                "Principal":{  (it tells to which account or user or role you are going to apply the poicy)
                  "AWS":["arn:aws:iam:12345678012:root"]  (and with this it seems applying policy to root user of your AWS account)
                },
                "Action":[  (list of API , either allow or deny based on effects)
                  "ec2.Describe*",
                  "s3:GetObject",
                  "s3:PutObject"
                ]
                "Resorce":["arn:aws:s3::myBucket/*"],  (it simply define list of resources where we are going to use for this policy)
                "Condition":  (condition whn we impliment this policy: Optional)
              }
            ]
          }

  IAM Policy Hands-On:
    so as we have created the user so this user have the admin access, we can remove the access
    * simply go to root user account >> open the Group tab >> there you will see the admin group >> click on it >> you will see the list of user added to group >> remove the user
      and once it is removed new user named stephan cannot view any user at there end (both consol have the same GUI differnec is only level of access)
    * so we ahve removed from group, lets create the another group and it will be created from the root account
      go to permission tab >> you will see numbr of policies >> Add permission policies >> attach policy directly >> search policy name IAMReadOnlyAccess >> add permission
    * so above you have created user and the group, you can also create policy, and view all policy preset in the AWS
      -simply go to policy in left dashbard you will see list of policies click on it to ge the details and there JSON working 
      -to create new policy >> visual or json selevct your choice >> visual >> select the service IAM >> Action applied , list user, get user, >> select resources >> next >> policy name >> create policy

  IAM MFA:
    * Password policies need to be set, like Password, uppercase, one lower + slecial character and length, 
      must be change after sometime, user must able to login etc
    * Can setup the MFA for user, its simple Multifactor authentication, it can be:
        Virtual MFA: Google Authenticator, or Authy (by Amazon)
        Universal 2nd Factor Security Key:  Yubikey by Yubico, its pend drive like harddive consist of key, need to insert that key in your device for authentication
      MFA Device in AWS:
        Hardware Key Fob MFA Device:provided by gemlto third party to AWS 
        Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud (US): provided by SurePassID third party
  Setting up MFA:
    * For Password policies setup:
        Go to Account Settings >> Password Policy Edit >> set up with IAM password or Custom password and check the policies you need
    * MFA policies setup: 
        Click on top right account name >> security credentials >> Set up MFA >> Authenticator App [Security Key, hardware key] >> download Authy app in ypur mobile device
        >> generate the QR code >> scan the QR code from mobile >> verify two MFA code from mobile >> add MFA

  AWS access ways:
    * three ways to access the AWS:
        AWS Management console (by using the MFA + password)
        AWS CLI (protected by the access key )
        AWS SDK, for code protected by access key
      access key are secrete dont share it with anyone

  AWS Clis installation on windows
    * simply go to the google, search for AWS cli for windows and they will provide you the same
      open link get it download and use admin rights to get it installed

  Creating access Key:
    * after installing now we are back to the amazon user dashboard
        click on your name >> security credentials >> scroll down Access key- create access key >> command line interface >> next >> create access key
    * now you got the key, so simply open installed CLI for AWS write command
        aws configured >> it will ask for access ID and password (provide it from access key created) >> and further details 
      once configured get the details, via command
        aws iam list-users (it will give the list of all user in your account)

  CloudShell:
    * on search bar enter CloudShell, >> open it you will see the comand prompt type thing, >> sleect the region as it is availble for few regions >> and do you command things

  Creating IAM ROle:
    * basically IAM ROle is to create a user which will work on your behalf , its not the physical user just virtual server and it is EC2 instance for us
      there are other Role as well
        EC2 Intance role
        Lambda Function role
        Roles of cloud formation 

  Creating Role:
    * go to Role on left dashboard >> AWS Services >> Use case (select the service to which  this role applied) >> EC2 >> next >> add a policies to role >> IAMReadOnlyAccess >>
      next >> Role Name >> Description >> create Role

  IAM Security Tool:
    * Two security Tools
        IAM Credential Report (account level): a report that list all your account users and various credential status
        IAM Access Advisor (user level): it shows the service permission granted to the user and when it was last accessed, we can use this information to revice policies

  Working on IAM security Tool:
    * For IAM Crendetials Report
        go to credential report >> download report (you will see the excel file conating list of users , level of access, when ws last time or not and many other details)
    * For IAM Access Advisor: (it will show me which services is access by the user and when)
        Users >> click on user >> Access Advisor >>
